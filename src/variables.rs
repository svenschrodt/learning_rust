/**
 * Public module testing basic usage of variables in Rust
 * 
 * 
 * Lesson goals: 
 * 
 * - By default variables in Rust are immutable ðŸ¤£ - it's a feature, we will see that l8er
 * - Variables are holding primitive data or references to data Variables 
 * - Rust variables are block-scoped {Rust in general is block-scoped}
 * - variable names in Rust are - *by convention* - named /under_scored/, rather than /camelCased/
